# MapPet Application

This project stands for pet lovers who are interested in animals. Therefore, people who love to chill out at the cafe can use this application to find the pet cafe that they pleased. Our team members want to make a perfect application for pet lovers which is a pet cafe location application in the name of “MapPet”. The problem statement of this project is pet lovers don't have any idea about pet cafe. For this reason, our application will help them to find the nearest pet cafe and also show the recommended cafe for them.
There are three options for pet lovers as follows: dog, cat, and exotic pet. 

The users can select an option for the type of pet they want to play with, then the application will suggest the nearest location of the cafe and it suggests the location of the other recommended cafe as well. The users can decide by seeing some pictures of the pet cafe which shows the style and environment of each cafe. Moreover, our application will show the rate price of food and drink of each pet cafe to make the users more comfortable to choose. After selecting the pet cafe, the application will show the map location of the pet cafe which is selected by a user.
